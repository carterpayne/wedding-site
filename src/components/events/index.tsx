              If you are in town Saturday morning, join us at the Farmerâ€™s Market! Open from 7:00 am until 1:00 pm, the market offers delicious locally-grown fruits and vegetables, along with baked goods, jams, jellies, flowers and more. We love the breakfast burritos and lavender cake donuts! The market is located at the Railyard and there is parking available in the garage (driving entrance / exit is between REI and the Sanbusco Center).
